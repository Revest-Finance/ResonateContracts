    //   DAI and USDC will be close to 1.0, despite DAI having 18 decimals and USDC 6.
    //
    // - BPT_PRICE: the price of the Pool share token (BPT), in units of the first token.
    //   Note that the price is computed *including* the tokens decimals. This means that the BPT price of a Pool with
    //   USDC in which BPT is worth $5 will be 5.0, despite the BPT having 18 decimals and USDC 6.
    //
    // - INVARIANT: the value of the Pool's invariant, which serves as a measure of its liquidity.
